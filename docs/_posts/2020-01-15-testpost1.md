November 2020 was one to remember -and for fans of My Hero Academia, it wasn’t necessarily for the US elections. The long-awaited confirmation of the fan-favorite theory concerning the villain Dabi’s true identity arrived in the form of Chapter 290. 

So how was this reflected in what creators put on the archive? On average, there was a 10% decrease in the use of the two similar tags Dabi is a Todoroki and Dabi is Todoroki Touya.

This isn’t immediately obvious when looking at the day-by-day numbers of fics with the Dabi character tags updating or being published (grey line). However, applying a 30-day rolling window makes the trend clear (orange line).
